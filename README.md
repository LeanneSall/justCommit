# justCommit

## Description
I'm not sure about how everyone else does but I find I never commit my code as frequently as I would like that is why I decided to make this little desktop app. This desktop app lets you select the amount of time you will be working for and allows you to select how often you would like to commit your code. When the time comes up that you should commit your code you will get a sound and visual notification on your desktop as a reminder to commit your code. Simple but needed for the forgetful
